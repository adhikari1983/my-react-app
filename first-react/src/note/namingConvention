The difference in capitalization—PascalCase for components vs. camelCase for logic—is a 
crucial naming convention that tells everyone, including React itself, what the file is supposed to do.

1. Why Components are PascalCase (Header.jsx)
React components (the files that return JSX/UI) must start with a capital letter (PascalCase) for 
two main reasons:
A. React's Requirement
                      React needs to distinguish your custom components from standard HTML elements.
e.g. <div>, <span>, <p>: Lowercase tags are treated as standard HTML elements.
e.g  <Header>, <Food>, <Student>: Capitalized tags are treated as React Components.

If you were to name your file header.jsx and try to use it as <header>, React would treat it like the standard HTML <header> tag, and your component wouldn't render correctly.

B. JavaScript Convention
                        In JavaScript, PascalCase is the standard convention for defining Classes and Constructors. 
Since React components (even functional ones) represent a kind of structured, reusable "building block," 
they follow this class-like naming convention.


2. Why Logic/Utility Files are camelCase (data.js)
Logic, utility, and helper files are generally named using camelCase (starting with a lowercase letter) 
because they typically export:
A. Simple Data Variables or Arrays
The file data.js mainly exports variables (like studentData or navigationLinks). In JavaScript, it's standard 
practice to name variables and constants using camelCase.
                                                         Example: const studentData = [...]

B. Utility Functions
The file helpers.js mainly exports non-UI-related functions (like calculateBMI or formatDate). Functions in JavaScript are almost always named using camelCase.
                                    Example: export function calculateGrade(score) { ... }

These files are not React components, so they do not return JSX, and therefore they do not follow the component naming rule.

Naming Summary

File Type                                           Casing             Example           Purpose Signal
React Component (Returns JSX)                      PascalCase           Student.jsx       "I am a reusable UI element."

Logic/Utility File (Returns Data/Functions)        camelCase            helpers.js        "I contain standard JavaScript logic."

Folder                                             kebab-case           first-class/       "I am a directory."

By sticking to these conventions, any developer can immediately know the role of a file just by looking at the first letter of its name.
