⚙️ What Actually Happens Behind the Scenes
Let’s break your thought process step-by-step 👇

🧱 1️⃣ You have two key players:
<Link> → creates a clickable navigation element.
<Route> → tells React which component to render for which URL path.


Example:
<Link to="/card">Card</Link>
<Route path="/card" element={<Card />} />


🚀 2️⃣ When you click the <Link>
React Router does NOT reload the page like a normal <a href> tag.
Instead, it changes the browser’s URL using the History API (internally, it calls history.pushState()).

Example: Clicking “Card” changes the URL from
http://localhost:5173/

to
http://localhost:5173/card




🧭 3️⃣ The <Routes> component then “listens” to that URL change.
It checks all registered <Route> paths inside it.
It finds the matching one — for example, /card.
Then it renders the component that corresponds to that route — in this case, <Card />.



🧩 4️⃣ React updates only the part of the page that changed.
The Navbar stays visible (since it’s outside <Routes>).
The main content area swaps out <Card /> for whichever component matches the route.
No full reload, no loss of state — just smooth client-side rendering.



⚡ Simplified in your words:
“When I click a <Link>, it changes the URL (internally, not reloading), and the <Routes> component detects 
that new URL, matches it to a <Route> path, and renders that component.”

✅ That’s exactly right — just think:
Link → changes the URL
Route → listens & renders the correct component



🧠 Quick Analogy:
Imagine a library with many rooms (Card room, Props room, etc.):


Navbar (Links) → doors with room labels.
Routes (in App.jsx) → floor plan telling which room matches which door.
Click a Link → you walk into that room (React swaps out the view without leaving the building).



Would you like me to make a visual diagram showing how the Link, URL, and Route interact dynamically 
inside the browser (with arrows showing the flow)?
